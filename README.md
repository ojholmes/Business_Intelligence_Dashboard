# Business_Intelligence_Dashboard
## Project Overview
As part of my Google Business Intelligence Certification, I developed a comprehensive dashboard for Google Fiber Customer Support Team to analyze trends of repeat callers based on the category of calls and the market area, and to improve overall customer satisfaction.
I used the project planning documents and completed target table to build a BI visualization tool.

## Scenario
The Google Fiber customer service team’s goal is to determine how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leadership understand how effectively the team is able to answer customer questions the first time. The dashboard you create should demonstrate an understanding of this goal and provide your stakeholders with insights about repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent. As part of the interview process, you have been asked to create a dashboard that will: 
- Help them understand how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leadership understand how effectively the team is able to answer customer questions the first time
- Provide insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls
- Explore repeat caller trends in the three different market cities
- Design charts so that stakeholders can view trends by week, month, quarter, and year.

## Methodology
### Load data into Tableau
### Create a mockup
### Create data charts
### Organize dashboard
### Complete executive summary

## Descriptions of columns:
date_created = creation of customer support calls
contacts_n = number of first calls
contacts_n_1 = number of follow-up calls (out of the first calls) after 1 day
contacts_n_2 = number of follow-up calls (out of the first calls) after 2 days
contacts_n_3 = number of follow-up calls (out of the first calls) after 3 days
contacts_n_4 = number of follow-up calls (out of the first calls) after 4 days
contacts_n_5 = number of follow-up calls (out of the first calls) after 5 days
contacts_n_6 = number of follow-up calls (out of the first calls) after 6 days
contacts_n_7 = number of follow-up calls (out of the first calls) after 7 days
new_type = type of the problem for the call (type_1 = account management, type_2 = technician troubleshooting, type_3 = scheduling, type_4 = construction, type_5 = internet and wifi)
new_market = there are 3 possible values (market_1, market_2, market_3) that correspond to different cities and that are anonymized by the course instructors

## Stakeholder’s Problem
The stakeholder is the Google Fiber Customer Service Team who wants to answer these questions:

How often does the customer service team receive repeat calls (follow-ups) within the next 7 days after the first calls of the same customers?
What problem type generates the most repeat calls?
From which market city the customer service team receives the most repeat calls?

## Key Insights
### Customer Acquisition and Retention:

- Customer Segmentation: Identify distinct customer segments based on demographics, usage patterns, and other relevant factors. Analyze the characteristics of high-value customers and those prone to churn.
- Marketing Campaign Effectiveness: Evaluate the performance of different marketing channels (e.g., digital ads, direct mail, social media) in terms of customer acquisition cost and return on investment.
- Customer Satisfaction and Net Promoter Score (NPS): Track customer satisfaction and NPS over time to identify trends and areas for improvement. Analyze the correlation between customer satisfaction and churn rates.

### Network Performance and Optimization:
- Network Outage Analysis: Identify the root causes of network outages and their impact on customer satisfaction. Analyze the effectiveness of maintenance and repair procedures.
- Network Traffic Patterns: Analyze network traffic patterns to identify peak usage times and potential congestion points. Use this information to optimize network capacity and performance.
- Internet Speed and Latency: Monitor internet speed and latency to ensure that Google Fiber meets its service level agreements (SLAs). Identify areas with suboptimal performance and take corrective action.

### Financial Performance and Forecasting:

- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV): Calculate the CLTV of different customer segments to inform pricing strategies and customer retention efforts.
- Churn Rate Analysis: Analyze churn rates by customer segment and identify the key drivers of churn. Use this information to develop targeted retention strategies.
- Revenue and Cost Forecasting: Develop accurate forecasts of revenue and costs to support strategic planning and budgeting decisions.

### Competitive Analysis:

- Market Share Analysis: Track Google Fiber's market share and competitive position in different geographic markets. Analyze the competitive landscape and identify opportunities for growth.
- Competitive Pricing Analysis: Analyze the pricing strategies of competitors and assess the impact of price changes on customer behavior and revenue.
